possession of the thing ends.

if:
(a) in a paragraph (4)(b) case:
(i) proceedings in respect of which the thing might provide 
evidence have been instituted before the end of the 60 
day period and have not been completed (including an 
appeal to a court in relation to those proceedings); or
(ii) the authorised officer may retain the thing because of an 
order under section 252E; or
(b) in any caseâ€”the authorised officer is otherwise authorised 
(by a law, or an order of a court or a tribunal, of the 
Commonwealth or a State or Territory) to retain, destroy or 
dispose of the thing.
