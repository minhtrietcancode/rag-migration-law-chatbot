Interaction with monitoring conditions on certain bridging visas
(6) To avoid doubt, if a removal pathway non-citizen covered by 
paragraph (b) of the definition of that expression in subsection 5(1) 
refuses or fails to comply with a removal pathway direction, the 
refusal or failure does not constitute a failure to comply with a 
requirement of a monitoring condition (within the meaning of 
subsection 76B(4)) for the purposes of paragraph 76B(1)(d).
Multiple and concurrent directions
(7) A non-citizen may be given more than one removal pathway 
direction.

to a non-citizen to do a thing, or not do a thing:
(a) that is the subject of a direction previously given by the 
Minister to the non-citizen; and
(b) for which the period specified in the previous direction for 
the thing has not ended.
