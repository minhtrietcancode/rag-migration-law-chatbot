Subdivision AC—Grant of visas
65  Decision to grant or refuse to grant visa
(1) Subject to sections 84 and 86, after considering a valid application 
for a visa, the Minister:
(a) if satisfied that:
(i) the health criteria for it (if any) have been satisfied; and
(ii) the other criteria for it prescribed by this Act or the 
regulations have been satisfied; and
(iii) the grant of the visa is not prevented by section 40 
(circumstances when granted), 91W (evidence of 
identity and bogus documents), 91WA (bogus 
documents and destroying identity documents), 91WB 
(applications for protection visas by members of same 
family unit), 500A (refusal or cancellation of temporary 
safe haven visas), 501 (special power to refuse or 
cancel) or any other provision of this Act or of any other 
law of the Commonwealth; and
(iv) any amount of visa application charge payable in 
relation to the application has been paid;
is to grant the visa; or
(b) if not so satisfied, is to refuse to grant the visa.
Note 1: Section 84 allows the Minister to suspend the processing of 
applications for visas of a kind specified in a determination made 
under that section. Section 86 prevents the Minister from granting a 
visa of a kind specified in a determination under section 85 if the 
number of such visas granted in a specified financial year has reached 
a specified maximum number.
Note 2: See also section 195A, under which the Minister has a 
non-compellable power to grant a visa to a person in detention under 
section 189 (whether or not the person has applied for the visa). 
Subdivision AA, this Subdivision, Subdivision AF and the regulations 
do not apply to the Minister’s power under that section.
(2) To avoid doubt, an application put aside under section 94 is not 
taken for the purposes of subsection (1) to have been considered 
until it has been removed from the pool under subsection 95(3).
