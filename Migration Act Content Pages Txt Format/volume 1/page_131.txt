76A  Cessation of certain bridging visas, and grant of new visas, for 
certain non-citizens
(1) This section applies if:
(a) a non-citizen holds a Subclass 070 (Bridging (Removal 
Pending)) visa (the first visa) immediately before the 
commencement of this section; and
(b) the first visa was granted to the non-citizen without an 
application for the first visa being made by the non-citizen; 
and
(c) the first visa was granted during the period that:
(i) starts at the start of 8 November 2023; and
(ii) ends immediately before the commencement of this 
section; and
(d) at the time the first visa was granted, there was no real 
prospect of the removal of the non-citizen from Australia 
becoming practicable in the reasonably foreseeable future.
(2) Despite any other provision of this Act or the regulations, the first 
visa ceases to be in effect immediately after the commencement of 
this section.
Note: The visa period for the first visa ends when it ceases to be in effect 
under this subsection.
(3) Despite any other provision of this Act or the regulations:
(a) the non-citizen is taken, immediately after the first visa 
ceases to be in effect under subsection (2), to have been 
granted another Subclass 070 (Bridging (Removal Pending)) 
visa (the second visa); and
(b) the second visa is taken to come into effect as soon as it is 
taken to be granted under paragraph (a) of this subsection.
Note: The visa period for the second visa begins when it is taken to be 
granted.
(4) This Act and the regulations apply, after the commencement of this 
section, in relation to the second visa in the same way as they 
would apply in relation to a Subclass 070 (Bridging (Removal 
Pending)) visa granted under the regulations.
