(g) section 37 (bridging visas);
(h) section 37A (temporary safe haven visas);
(i) section 38 (criminal justice visas);
(j) section 38A (enforcement visas);
(k) section 38B (maritime crew visas).
(3) The regulations may prescribe criteria for a visa or visas of a 
specified class (which, without limiting the generality of this 
subsection, may be a class provided for by section 32, 35A, 37, 
37A or 38B but not by section 33, 34, 35, 38 or 38A).
(3A) To avoid doubt, subsection (3) does not require criteria to be 
prescribed for a visa or visas including, without limitation, visas of 
the following classes:
(a) special category visas (see section 32);
(b) permanent protection visas (see subsection 35A(2));
(c) temporary protection visas (see subsection 35A(3));
(ca) safe haven enterprise visas (see subsection 35A(3A));
(d) bridging visas (see section 37);
(e) temporary safe haven visas (see section 37A);
(f) maritime crew visas (see section 38B).
Note 1: An application for any of these visas is invalid if criteria relating to 
both the application and the grant of the visa have not been prescribed 
(see subsection 46AA(2)).
Note 2: If criteria are prescribed by the regulations for any of these visas, the 
visa cannot be granted unless any criteria prescribed by this Act, as 
well as any prescribed by regulation, are satisfied (see 
subsection 46AA(4)).
(4) The regulations may prescribe whether visas of a class are visas to 
travel to and enter Australia, or to remain in Australia, or both.
(5) A visa is a visa of a particular class if this Act or the regulations 
specify that it is a visa of that class.
