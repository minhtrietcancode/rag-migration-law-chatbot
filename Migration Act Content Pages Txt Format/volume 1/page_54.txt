6  Effect of limited meaning of enter Australia etc.
To avoid doubt, although subsection 5(1) limits, for the purposes of 
this Act, the meanings of enter Australia, leave Australia and 
remain in Australia and as well, because of section 18A of the 
Acts Interpretation Act 1901, the meaning of parts of speech and 
grammatical forms of those phrases, this does not mean:
(a) that, for those purposes, the meaning of in Australia, to 
Australia or any other phrase is limited; or
(b) that this Act does not extend to parts of Australia outside the 
migration zone; or
(c) that this Act does not apply to persons in those parts.
Note: See also subsection 9A(3), which deals with when a person is taken to 
be in Australia, to travel to Australia, to enter Australia or to leave 
Australia. Section 9A concerns offshore resources activities.
