(7) For the purposes of this Act, if, immediately before the conversion 
time for a pre-conversion application, a person had made an 
application for a bridging visa because of the pre-conversion 
application, but the bridging visa application had not been finally 
determined, then, at and after the conversion time:
(a) the bridging visa application is taken to have been applied for 
because of the converted application; and
(b) the bridging visa (if granted) has effect as if it were granted 
because of the converted application.
Note: This Act and the regulations would apply to a bridging visa to which 
subsection (6) or (7) applies, and to when the bridging visa would 
cease to have effect, in the same way as this Act and the regulations 
would apply in relation to any bridging visa.
For example, such a bridging visa would generally cease to be in 
effect under section 82 if and when the substantive visa is granted 
because of the converted application.
Conversion regulation may affect accrued rights etc.
(8) To avoid doubt:
(a) subsection 12(2) (retrospective application of legislative 
instruments) of the Legislation Act 2003 does not apply in 
relation to the effect of a conversion regulation (including a 
conversion regulation enacted by the Parliament); and
(b) subsection 7(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, including 
that subsection as applied by section 13 of the Legislation Act 
2003, does not apply in relation to the enactment of this 
section or the making of a conversion regulation (including a 
conversion regulation enacted by the Parliament).
45A  Visa application charge
A non-citizen who makes an application for a visa is liable to pay 
visa application charge if, assuming the charge were paid, the 
application would be a valid visa application.
