Note: However, a non-citizen might also hold another class of visa that 
allows the non-citizen to travel to and enter Australia by air.
(3) The Minister may make a written declaration, for the purposes of 
this section, that it is undesirable that a person, or any persons in a 
class of persons, travel to and enter Australia, or remain in 
Australia.
(4) If the Minister makes a declaration under subsection (3) in relation 
to a person, or a class of persons of which a person is a member, a 
maritime crew visa held by that person ceases to be in effect:
(a) if the Minister specifies a time in the declaration (which must 
be after the time when the declaration is made) as the time 
the declaration takes effect—at the time so specified; or
(b) if the Minister does not specify such a time in the 
declaration—at the end of the day on which the declaration is 
made.
Note: A maritime crew visa can also cease to be in effect under other 
sections (see for example section 82).
(5) If the Minister revokes a declaration made under subsection (4), 
the Minister is taken never to have made the declaration.
Note: Under subsection 33(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, the 
Minister may revoke a declaration made under subsection (4).
(6) Despite subsection (5), any detention of the non-citizen that 
occurred during any part of the period:
(a) beginning when the Minister made the declaration; and
(b) ending at the time of the revocation of the declaration;
is lawful and the non-citizen is not entitled to make any claim 
against the Commonwealth, an officer or any other person because 
of the detention.
39  Criterion limiting number of visas
(1) In spite of section 14 of the Legislation Act 2003, a prescribed 
criterion for visas of a class, other than protection visas, may be the 
criterion that the grant of the visa would not cause the number of 
visas of that class granted in a particular financial year to exceed
