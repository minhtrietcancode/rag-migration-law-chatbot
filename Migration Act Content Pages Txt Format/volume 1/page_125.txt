Migration Act 1958 125
Compilation No. 164 Compilation date: 21/02/2025(a) the non-citizen does not hold a substantive visa that is in 
effect; and
(b) either:
(i) the non-citizen does not hold any other bridging visa; or
(ii) the reactivated bridging visa is determined, in 
accordance with the regulations, to be the most 
beneficial of the bridging visas held by the applicant.
(5) Subsection (4) does not apply in relation to a Subclass 070 
(Bridging (Removal Pending)) visa (the first visa) for a non-citizen 
that ceases to be in effect under subsection 82(3) if the first visa 
ceases to be in effect under subsection 82(3) because another 
Subclass 070 (Bridging (Removal Pending)) visa for the 
non-citizen comes into effect.
(6) For the purposes of subparagraph (b)(ii) of the definition of visa 
period in subsection 5(1), the first visa is to be taken to have 
ceased to be in effect otherwise than under subsection 82(3).
Note: This means that the visa period for the first visa ends when the second 
visa comes into effect.
69  Effect of compliance or non-compliance
(1) Non-compliance by the Minister with Subdivision AA or AB or 
section 494D in relation to a visa application does not mean that a 
decision to grant or refuse to grant the visa is not a valid decision 
but only means that the decision might have been the wrong one 
and might be set aside if reviewed.
(2) If the Minister deals with a visa application in a way that complies 
with Subdivision AA, AB and this Subdivision, the Minister is not 
required to take any other action in dealing with it.
