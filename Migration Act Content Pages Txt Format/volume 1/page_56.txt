in the migration zone under this section if the person is supporting the 
offshore resources activity.
Example 3: Neither a stowaway on the vessel, nor a person on the vessel because 
the person was rescued at sea, is taken to be in the migration zone, 
because neither is participating in, or supporting, the offshore 
resources activity.
(2) To avoid doubt, a person may be taken to be in the migration zone 
under subsection (1):
(a) whether or not the person’s participation in, or support of, an
