(2) Without limiting subsection (1), the Minister may, by written 
notice given to a removal pathway non-citizen, direct the 
non-citizen to do a thing, or not do a thing, if the Minister is 
satisfied that the non-citizen doing, or not doing, the thing is 
reasonably necessary to:
(a) determine whether there is a real prospect of the removal of 
the non-citizen from Australia under section 198 becoming 
practicable in the reasonably foreseeable future; or
(b) facilitate the removal of the non-citizen from Australia under 
that section.
Note 1: For the circumstances in which the Minister must not give a direction 
under subsection (1) or (2), see section 199D.
Note 2: The Minister may give a direction under subsection (1) or (2) to a 
removal pathway non-citizen during the period that the non-citizen’s 
removal is not required or authorised under section 198 as a result of 
the Minister considering whether to exercise a Ministerial intervention 
power in relation to the non-citizen (see section 197E).
(3) The Minister may, by written notice given to a removal pathway 
non-citizen, revoke a removal pathway direction given to the 
non-citizen.

thing; or
(b) for a direction not to do a specified thing—the period during 
which the non-citizen must not do the thing.
Consequences of non-compliance
(5) A removal pathway direction must state that a non-citizen who 
refuses or fails to comply with the direction may commit an 
offence under section 199E.
