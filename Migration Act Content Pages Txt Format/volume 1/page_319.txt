Subdivision A—Removal
197C  Relevance of Australia’s non-refoulement obligations to 
removal of unlawful non-citizens under section 198
(1) For the purposes of section 198, it is irrelevant whether Australia 
has non-refoulement obligations in respect of an unlawful 
non-citizen.
(2) An officer’s duty to remove as soon as reasonably practicable an 
unlawful non-citizen under section 198 arises irrespective of 
whether there has been an assessment, according to law, of 
Australia’s non-refoulement obligations in respect of the 
non-citizen.
(3) Despite subsections (1) and (2), section 198 does not require or 
authorise an officer to remove an unlawful non-citizen to a country 
if:
(a) the non-citizen has made a valid application for a protection 
visa that has been finally determined; and
(b) in the course of considering the application, a protection 
finding within the meaning of subsection (4), (5), (6) or (7) 
was made for the non-citizen with respect to the country 
(whether or not the visa was refused or was granted and has 
since been cancelled); and
(c) none of the following apply:
(i) the decision in which the protection finding was made 
has been quashed or set aside;
(ii) a decision made under subsection 197D(2) in relation to 
the non-citizen is complete within the meaning of 
subsection 197D(6);
(iii) the non-citizen has asked the Minister, in writing, to be 
removed to the country.
