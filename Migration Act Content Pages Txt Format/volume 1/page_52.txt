5K  Membership of a particular social group consisting of family
For the purposes of the application of this Act and the regulations 
to a particular person (the first person), in determining whether the 
first person has a well-founded fear of persecution for the reason of 
membership of a particular social group that consists of the first 
person’s family:
(a) disregard any fear of persecution, or any persecution, that any 
other member or former member (whether alive or dead) of 
the family has ever experienced, where the reason for the fear 
or persecution is not a reason mentioned in 
paragraph 5J(1)(a); and
(b) disregard any fear of persecution, or any persecution, that:
(i) the first person has ever experienced; or
(ii) any other member or former member (whether alive or 
dead) of the family has ever experienced;
where it is reasonable to conclude that the fear or persecution 
would not exist if it were assumed that the fear or persecution 
mentioned in paragraph (a) had never existed.
Note: Section 5G may be relevant for determining family relationships for 
the purposes of this section.
5L  Membership of a particular social group other than family
For the purposes of the application of this Act and the regulations 
to a particular person, the person is to be treated as a member of a 
particular social group (other than the person’s family) if:
(a) a characteristic is shared by each member of the group; and
(b) the person shares, or is perceived as sharing, the 
characteristic; and
(c) any of the following apply:
(i) the characteristic is an innate or immutable 
characteristic;
(ii) the characteristic is so fundamental to a member’s 
identity or conscience, the member should not be forced 
to renounce it;
