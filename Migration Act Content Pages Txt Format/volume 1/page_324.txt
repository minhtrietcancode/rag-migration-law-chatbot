(3) Subsection (1) applies whether a request is made by:
(a) the unlawful non-citizen; or
(b) an officer of the Department; or
(c) any other person.
(4) Subsection (1) applies whether or not a request has been drawn to 
the Minister’s attention.
Temporary suspension of duty to remove unlawful non-citizens
(5) Despite subsection (1), if the Minister decides to consider whether 
to exercise a Ministerial intervention power (whether on request or 
otherwise) in relation to an unlawful non-citizen, section 198 does 
not require or authorise an officer to remove the non-citizen from 
Australia during the period covered by subsection (6).
Note: Despite this subsection, an unlawful non-citizen who asks the 
Minister, in writing, to be removed, must be removed under 
subsection 198(1) (see subsection (11) of this section).
Period during which duty to remove is suspended
(6) For the purposes of subsection (5), the period is 6 months starting 
on the day (the start day) the Minister decides to consider whether 
to exercise the Ministerial intervention power in relation to the 
unlawful non-citizen, unless:
(a) before the end of that 6 month period, the unlawful 
non-citizen has agreed, in writing, to a day occurring after the 
end of that 6 month period nominated, in writing, by the 
Minister—in which case the period ends on the agreed day 
(subject to paragraph (b)); or
(b) the period ends earlier under subsection (7).
(7) For the purposes of paragraph (6)(b), the period ends at the earliest 
of the following times:
(a) the end of the day the Minister decides not to exercise the 
Ministerial intervention power in relation to the unlawful 
non-citizen;
