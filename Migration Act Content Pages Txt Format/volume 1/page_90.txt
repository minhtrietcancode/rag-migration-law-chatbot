(a) classes of visas, including protection visas and any other 
classes of visas provided for by this Act or the regulations; 
and
(b) classes of applicants, including applicants having a particular 
status; and
(c) applicants for a visa who are taken to have applied for the 
visa by the operation of this Act or the regulations.
Example:If a non-citizen applies for a visa, and then, before the application 
is decided, gives birth to a child, in some circumstances the child 
is taken, by the operation of the regulations, to have applied for a 
visa of the same class at the time the child is born (see 
regulation 2.08).
Conversion regulation
(3) For the purposes of this Act, a regulation (a conversion regulation) 
may provide that, despite anything else in this Act, the 
pre-conversion application for the pre-conversion visa:
(a) is taken not to be, and never to have been, a valid application 
for the pre-conversion visa; and
(b) is taken to be, and always to have been, a valid application (a 
converted application) for a visa of a different class 
(specified by the conversion regulation) made by the 
applicant for the pre-conversion visa.
Note: This section may apply in relation to a pre-conversion application 
made before the commencement of the section (see the Migration and 
Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum 
Legacy Caseload) Act 2014).
For example, a conversion regulation (made after the commencement 
of this section) could have the effect that a pre-conversion application 
for a particular type of visa made on 1 August 2014 (before that 
commencement):
(a) is taken not to have been made on 1 August 2014 (or ever); and
(b) is taken to be, and always to have been, a converted application 
for another type of visa made on 1 August 2014.
(4) Without limiting subsection (3), a conversion regulation may:
(a) prescribe a class or classes of pre-conversion visas; and
(b) prescribe a class of applicants for pre-conversion visas; and
