(a) a person covered by a residence determination is temporarily 
staying at a place other than the place specified in the 
determination; and

determination by staying there;
then, for the purposes of subsection (1), the person is taken still to

What constitutes release from immigration detention?
(4) If:
(a) a residence determination is in force in relation to a person; 
and
(b) a provision of this Act requires the person to be released 
from immigration detention, or this Act no longer requires or 
permits the person to be detained;
then, at the time when paragraph (b) becomes satisfied, the 
residence determination, so far as it covers the person, is revoked 
by force of this subsection and the person is, by that revocation, 
released from immigration detention.
Note: Because the residence determination is revoked, the person is no 
longer subject to the conditions specified in the determination.
(5) If a person is released from immigration detention by operation of 
subsection (4), the Secretary must, as soon as possible, notify the 
person that he or she has been so released.
