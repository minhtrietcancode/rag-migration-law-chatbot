against a law of the State; and
(b) satisfactory arrangements have been made to make sure that

of bringing the non-citizen to, keeping the non-citizen in, and 
removing the non-citizen from, Australia;
the official may give a certificate that the presence of the 
non-citizen in Australia is required for the administration of 
criminal justice by the State.

(a) a certificate has been given under subsection (1) about a 
non-citizen; and
(b) the Minister considers that the temporary presence of the

the non-citizen should not be present in Australia;
the Minister may endorse the certificate with a statement that it is 
to be a criminal justice certificate for the purposes of this Division.
(3) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the cost of keeping the
