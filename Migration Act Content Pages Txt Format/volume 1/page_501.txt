the authorised officer may request that the person do some or all of 
the things in subsection (4) for the purpose of finding out whether 
the person has such a thing. A request may be made whether or not 
a request is also made to the person under subsection (1).
(4) An authorised officer may request that the person do one or more 
of the following:
(a) allow the authorised officer to inspect the things in the 
person’s possession;
(b) remove some or all of the person’s outer clothing such as a 
coat, jacket or similar item;
(c) remove items from the pockets of the person’s clothing;
(d) open a thing in the person’s possession, or remove the thing’s 
contents, to allow the authorised officer to inspect the thing 
or its contents;
(e) leave a thing in the person’s possession, or some or all of its 
contents, in a place specified by the authorised officer if he or 
she suspects on reasonable grounds that the thing or its 
contents are capable of concealing something that might:
(i) endanger the safety of the detainees, staff or other 
persons at the detention centre; or
(ii) disrupt the order or security arrangements at the 
detention centre.
(5) A person who leaves a thing (including any of its contents) in a 
place specified by an authorised officer is entitled to its return 
when the person leaves the detention centre.
(6) However, if possession of the thing, or any of those contents, by 
the person is unlawful under a Commonwealth law or in the State 
or Territory in which the detention centre is located:
(a) the thing or the contents must not be returned to the person; 
and
(b) an authorised officer must, as soon as practicable, give the 
thing or the contents to a constable (within the meaning of 
the Crimes Act 1914).
