subsection (3), there would be a real risk that the non-citizen 
will suffer significant harm in relation to the other country.
Determining nationality
(6) For the purposes of subsection (3), the question of whether a 
non-citizen is a national of a particular country must be determined 
solely by reference to the law of that country.
(7) Subsection (6) does not, by implication, affect the interpretation of 
any other provision of this Act.
36A  Consideration of protection obligations
(1) In considering a valid application for a protection visa made by a 
non-citizen, the Minister must consider and make a record of 
whether the Minister is satisfied of any of the following:
(a) the non-citizen satisfies the criterion in paragraph 36(2)(a) 
with respect to a country and also satisfies the criterion in 
subsection 36(1C);
(b) the non-citizen satisfies the criterion in paragraph 36(2)(aa) 
with respect to a country;
(c) the non-citizen:
(i) satisfies the criterion in paragraph 36(2)(a) with respect 
to a country but does not satisfy the criterion in 
subsection 36(1C); and
(ii) would satisfy the criterion in paragraph 36(2)(aa) with 
respect to a country except that the non-citizen is a 
non-citizen mentioned in paragraph 36(2)(a).
(2) The Minister must do so:
(a) before deciding whether to grant or refuse to grant the visa; 
and
(b) before considering whether the non-citizen satisfies any other 
criteria for the grant of the visa; and
(c) before considering whether the grant of the visa is prevented 
by any provision of the Act or regulations; and
(d) without regard to subsections 36(2C) and (3).
