Reasonable steps to prevent the contravention
(3) In determining whether the executive officer of the body corporate 
failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent the work-related

body’s employees, agents and contractors had a reasonable 
knowledge and understanding of the requirements to comply 
with this Subdivision, insofar as those requirements affected 
the employees, agents or contractors concerned; and
(b) what action (if any) the officer took when he or she became 
aware that the body was engaging in the work-related 
contravention.
