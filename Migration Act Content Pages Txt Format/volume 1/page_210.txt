(2) A non-citizen who is in the migration zone cannot apply for 
revocation at a time when, because of section 82, the visa would no 
longer have been in effect anyway had the visa not been cancelled 
under section 137J.
(3) In addition to the restriction in subsection (2), a non-citizen who is 
in the migration zone and who has been detained under section 189 
cannot apply for revocation later than:
(a) 2 working days after the day on which section 194 was 
complied with in relation to his or her detention; or
(b) if he or she informs an officer in writing within those 2 days 
of his or her intention to so apply—within the next 5 working 
days after those 2 working days.
(4) A non-citizen who is outside the migration zone cannot apply for 
revocation later than 28 days after the day of the cancellation.
(5) In any case, a non-citizen cannot apply for revocation if he or she 
has previously made such an application in respect of the same 
cancellation.
137L  Dealing with the application
(1) On an application under section 137K, the Minister may revoke the 
cancellation if, and only if, the applicant satisfies the Minister:
(a) that the non-citizen did not in fact breach the relevant visa 
condition or conditions; or
(b) that the breach was due to exceptional circumstances beyond 
the non-citizen’s control; or
(c) of any other matter prescribed in the regulations.
(2) However, the Minister must not revoke the cancellation on the 
ground that the non-citizen was unaware of the notice or of the 
effect of section 137J.
(3) A cancellation is revoked under this section by the Minister 
causing a record of the revocation to be made.
