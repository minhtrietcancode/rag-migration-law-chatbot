This Division applies to visas of a prescribed kind (however 
described).
140AA  Purposes of this Division
(1) The purposes of this Division, to the extent it applies in relation to 
the temporary sponsored work visa program, are as follows:
(a) to provide a framework for the program in order to address 
genuine skills shortages;
(b) to address genuine skills shortages in the Australian labour 
market:
(i) without displacing employment and training 
opportunities for Australian citizens and Australian 
permanent residents (within the meaning of the 
regulations); and
(ii) without the program serving as a mainstay of the skilled 
migration program;
(c) to balance the objective of ensuring employment and training 
opportunities for Australian citizens and Australian 
permanent residents with that of upholding the rights of 
non-citizens sponsored to work in Australia under the 
program;
(d) to impose obligations on work sponsors to ensure that:
(i) non-citizens sponsored to work in Australia under the 
program are protected; and
(ii) the program is not used inappropriately;
(e) to enable monitoring, detection, deterrence and enforcement 
in relation to any inappropriate use of the program;
