(22) If visa pre-application process charge is payable in respect of the 
registration of a person as a registered participant in a visa 
pre-application process, the charge is to be paid at the time of 
registration. If the charge is not paid at that time, the person is 
taken never to have been registered as a registered participant in 
the visa pre-application process.
(23) The regulations may:
(a) make provision for the remission, refund or waiver of visa 
pre-application process charge in specified circumstances; or
(b) make provision for exemptions from visa pre-application 
process charge.
Extra-territorial application
(24) This section extends to acts, omissions, matters and things outside 
Australia.
47  Consideration of valid visa application
(1) The Minister is to consider a valid application for a visa.
(2) The requirement to consider an application for a visa continues 
until:
(a) the application is withdrawn; or
(b) the Minister grants or refuses to grant the visa; or
(c) the further consideration is prevented by section 39 (limiting 
number of visas) or 84 (suspension of consideration).
(3) To avoid doubt, the Minister is not to consider an application that 
is not a valid application.
(4) To avoid doubt, a decision by the Minister that an application is 
not valid and cannot be considered is not a decision to refuse to 
grant the visa.
