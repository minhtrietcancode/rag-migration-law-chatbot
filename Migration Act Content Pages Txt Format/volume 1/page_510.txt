(b) must not be carried out in the presence or view of a person 
whose presence is not necessary for the purposes of the 
identification test or required or permitted by another 
provision of this Act; and
(c) must not involve the removal of more clothing than is 
necessary for carrying out the test; and
(d) must not involve more visual inspection than is necessary for 
carrying out the test.
258F  Person must not be required to provide personal identifiers in 
a cruel, inhuman or degrading way etc.
For the purposes of this Act, a requirement to provide a personal 
identifier, or the provision of a personal identifier, in a particular 
way under section 257A is not of itself taken:
(a) to be cruel, inhuman or degrading; or
(b) to be a failure to treat a person with humanity and with 
respect for human dignity.
However, nothing in this Act authorises the Minister or an officer 
to require a person to provide a personal identifier under 
section 257A in a cruel, inhuman or degrading way, or in a way 
that fails to treat the person with humanity and with respect for 
human dignity.
258G  Authorised officer may get help to carry out identification 
tests
An authorised officer may ask another authorised officer or an 
officer to help him or her to carry out the identification test, and the 
other person may give that help.
