(a) an authorised officer has carried out an identification test (the 
earlier test) on a non-citizen in accordance with this Division 
(including a test authorised under subsection (4)); and
(b) either:
(i) a personal identifier that is provided as a result of the 
earlier test being carried out is unusable; or
(ii) an authorised officer or an officer is not satisfied about 
the integrity of that personal identifier;
the officer who carried out the earlier test or another officer may 
require the non-citizen to provide the personal identifier again, and 
may carry out the test again in accordance with this Division, if:
(c) the requirement is made while the earlier test is being carried 
out or immediately after it was carried out; or
(d) carrying out the test again is authorised under subsection (4).
(2) If the non-citizen is required under subsection (1) to provide the 
personal identifier again, the non-citizen is taken, for the purposes 
of this Division, not to have provided the personal identifier as a 
result of the earlier test being carried out.

subsection (4)—a senior authorising officer (who is not an 
officer referred to in subsection (1)); or
(b) if the earlier test was a test authorised under subsection (4) 
by a senior authorising officer—the Secretary, Australian
