Protection if officers etc. act in good faith
(9B) Proceedings, whether civil or criminal, may not be instituted or 
continued, in respect of any action taken under subsection (9A), 
against the Commonwealth, an officer or any person assisting an 
officer if the officer or person who took the action acted in good 
faith and used no more force than was authorised by 
subsection (10).
Use of necessary and reasonable force
(10) An officer may use such force as is necessary and reasonable in the 
exercise of a power under this section.
Limit on use of force to board and search aircraft
(11) In boarding and searching the aircraft and searching or examining 
goods found on the aircraft, an officer must not damage the aircraft 
or goods by forcing open a part of the aircraft or goods unless:
(a) the person (if any) apparently in charge of the aircraft has 
been given a reasonable opportunity to open that part or the 
goods; or
(b) it is not reasonably practicable to give that person such an 
opportunity.
This subsection has effect despite paragraphs (3)(a) and (b) and 
subsection (10).
Limit on use of force to arrest or detain person on aircraft
(12) In arresting or detaining a person found on the aircraft, an officer:
(a) must not use more force, or subject the person to greater 
indignity, than is necessary and reasonable to make the arrest 
or detention, or to prevent the person escaping after the arrest 
or detention; and
(b) must not do anything likely to cause the person grievous 
bodily harm unless the officer believes on reasonable 
grounds that doing the thing is necessary to protect life or 
prevent serious injury of another person (including the 
officer).
