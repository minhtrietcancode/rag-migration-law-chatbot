212 Migration Act 1958
Compilation No. 164 Compilation date: 21/02/2025(4) The Minister does not have a duty to consider whether to exercise 
the power in subsection (1), whether or not the non-citizen or 
anyone else requests him or her to do so, or in any other 
circumstances.
(5) A cancellation is revoked under this section by the Minister 
causing a record of the revocation to be made.
137P  Effect of revocation
(1) If the cancellation of a visa is revoked under section 137L or 137N, 
the visa is taken never to have been cancelled under section 137J.
(2) If the revocation is under section 137L and the decision is made 
wholly or partly on the ground that paragraph 137L(1)(a) or (b) 
applies to the breach that was alleged in the notice mentioned in 
section 137J, then that breach cannot be a ground for cancelling the 
visa under section 116.
(3) However, a revocation under section 137L or 137N does not 
otherwise limit or affect any other power to cancel the visa under 
this Act.
(4) In particular, a different or later breach of a condition of the visa 
can be a ground for cancelling the visa under section 116.
(5) Despite subsection (1), any detention of the non-citizen that 
occurred during any part of the period:
(a) beginning when the visa was cancelled under section 137J; 
and
(b) ending at the time of the revocation of the cancellation;
is lawful and the non-citizen is not entitled to make any claim 
against the Commonwealth, an officer or any other person because 
of the detention.
