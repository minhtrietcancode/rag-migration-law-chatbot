Note 2: The visa period for the visa ends when it ceases to be in effect under 
this subsection.
(5) The rules of natural justice do not apply to the giving of a notice 
under subsection (2).
(6) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), a permission to enter the 
foreign country may be unconditional or a permission to enter that 
is subject to the non-citizen doing one or more things required by 
the foreign country that the non-citizen is capable of doing before 
entering the country.
(7) If:
(a) notice (the earlier notice) is given to a non-citizen under 
subsection (2) (including under a previous application of this 
subsection); and
(b) the non-citizen is subsequently granted another Subclass 070 
(Bridging (Removal Pending)) visa (the later visa); and
(c) this section starts to apply in relation to the non-citizen after 
the later visa is granted;
the Minister must give further notice under subsection (2) to the 
non-citizen.

(a) the country in relation to which paragraph (1)(b) is satisfied 
may be the same as, or different from, the country in relation 
to which paragraph (1)(b) was satisfied for the earlier notice; 
but
(b) the permission in relation to which paragraph (1)(b) is 
satisfied must be granted after the granting of the later visa.
(9) This section does not affect the operation of other provisions of 
this Act or the regulations that have the effect that a Subclass 070 
(Bridging (Removal Pending)) visa ceases to be in effect on the 
happening of a particular event, upon the holder ceasing to have a 
particular status or otherwise.
