(i) the detainee’s parent or guardian if that person is in 
immigration detention with the detainee and is readily 
available at the same place; or
(ii) if that is not acceptable to the detainee or 
subparagraph (i) does not apply—another person (other 
than an authorised officer) who is capable of 
representing the detainee’s interests and who, as far as is 
practicable in the circumstances, is acceptable to the 
detainee; and
(h) subject to subsection (4), if the detainee is at least 18, and is 
not incapable of managing his or her affairs—must be 
conducted in the presence of another person (if any) 
nominated by the detainee, if that other person is readily 
available at the same place as the detainee, and willing to 
attend the strip search within a reasonable time; and
(i) must not involve a search of the detainee’s body cavities; and
(j) must not involve the removal of more items of clothing, or 
more visual inspection, than the authorised officer 
conducting the search believes on reasonable grounds to be 
necessary to determine whether there is hidden on the 
detainee, in his or her clothing or in a thing in his or her 
possession a weapon or other thing described in 
subsection 252A(1); and
(k) must not be conducted with greater force than is reasonably 
necessary to conduct the strip search.
(2) Paragraphs (1)(d) and (e) do not apply to a parent or guardian, or 
person present because of subparagraph (1)(g)(ii), if the detainee 
has no objection to that person being present.
(3) Paragraphs (1)(d) and (e) do not apply to a person nominated by 
the detainee under paragraph (1)(h) to attend the strip search.
(4) Neither:
(a) a detainee’s refusal or failure to nominate a person under 
paragraph (1)(h) within a reasonable time; nor
(b) a detainee’s inability to nominate a person under that 
paragraph who is readily available at the same place as the
