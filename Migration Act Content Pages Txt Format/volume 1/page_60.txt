Part 2—Arrival, presence and departure of persons
Division 1—Immigration status
13  Lawful non-citizens
(1) A non-citizen in the migration zone who holds a visa that is in 
effect is a lawful non-citizen.
(2) An allowed inhabitant of the Protected Zone who is in a protected 
area in connection with the performance of traditional activities is a 
lawful non-citizen.
14  Unlawful non-citizens
(1) A non-citizen in the migration zone who is not a lawful non-citizen 
is an unlawful non-citizen.
(2) To avoid doubt, a non-citizen in the migration zone who, 
immediately before 1 September 1994, was an illegal entrant 
within the meaning of the Migration Act as in force then became, 
on that date, an unlawful non-citizen.
15  Effect of cancellation of visa on status
To avoid doubt, subject to subsection 13(2) (certain inhabitants of 
protected zone), if a visa is cancelled its former holder, if in the 
migration zone, becomes, on the cancellation, an unlawful 
non-citizen unless, immediately after the cancellation, the former 
holder holds another visa that is in effect.
16  Removal of immigration rights of inhabitant of Protected Zone
The Minister may declare, in writing, that it is undesirable that a 
specified inhabitant of the Protected Zone continue to be permitted 
to enter or remain in Australia.
