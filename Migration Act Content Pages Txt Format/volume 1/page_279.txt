Non-citizen in migration zone
(2) A non-citizen in the migration zone who does not already hold an 
enforcement visa is granted an enforcement visa when he or she is 
detained under Schedule 1A to the Fisheries Management Act 
1991 or Schedule 2 to the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984.
Note: The grant of an enforcement visa effectively cancels any temporary 
visa that the non-citizen may have held (see subsection 82(2A)).
Non-citizen in prescribed circumstances
(3) An enforcement visa is granted to a non-citizen (who does not 
already hold an enforcement visa) when a fisheries officer or a 
maritime officer exercises under, or for the purposes of, the

1984 a prescribed power in prescribed circumstances in relation to 
the non-citizen. The visa is granted at the time the power is 
exercised.
Note: The grant of an enforcement visa effectively cancels any temporary 
visa that the non-citizen may have held (see subsection 82(2A)).
