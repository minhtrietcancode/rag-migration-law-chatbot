236F  Evidentiary certificates—procedural matters
(1) A certificate issued under subsection 236E(1) must not be admitted 
in evidence in proceedings for an offence unless:
(a) the person charged with the offence; or
(b) a lawyer who has appeared for the person in those 
proceedings;
has, at least 28 days before the certificate is sought to be so 
admitted, been given a copy of the certificate together with notice 
of the intention to produce the certificate as evidence in the 
proceedings.
(2) If, under section 236E, a certificate is admitted in evidence in 
proceedings for an offence, the person charged with the offence 
may require the person who signed the certificate to be:
(a) called as a witness for the prosecution; and
(b) cross-examined as if the person who signed the certificate 
had given evidence of the matters stated in the certificate.
(3) However, subsection (2) does not entitle the person charged to 
require the person who signed the certificate to be called as a 
witness for the prosecution unless:
(a) the prosecutor has been given at least 21 days’ notice of the 
person’s intention to require the person who signed the 
certificate to be so called; and
(b) the court, by order, allows the person charged to require the 
person who signed the certificate to be so called.
