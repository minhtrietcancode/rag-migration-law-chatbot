certificate would have expired if this Act had not been 
passed.
(5) For the purposes of paragraph (4)(a), where, before the 
commencement of this Part, a person who had previously entered 
Australia re-entered Australia and, upon or after the re-entry, a 
certificate of exemption purported to be issued to the person, the 
certificate shall be deemed to have been as validly issued as if the 
person had not previously entered Australia.
3A  Act not to apply so as to exceed Commonwealth power
(1) Unless the contrary intention appears, if a provision of this Act:
(a) would, apart from this section, have an invalid application; 
but
(b) also has at least one valid application;
it is the Parliament’s intention that the provision is not to have the 
invalid application, but is to have every valid application.
(2) Despite subsection (1), the provision is not to have a particular 
valid application if:
(a) apart from this section, it is clear, taking into account the 
provision’s context and the purpose or object underlying this 
Act, that the provision was intended to have that valid 
application only if every invalid application, or a particular 
invalid application, of the provision had also been within the 
Commonwealth’s legislative power; or
(b) the provision’s operation in relation to that valid application 
would be different in a substantial respect from what would 
have been its operation in relation to that valid application if 
every invalid application of the provision had been within the 
Commonwealth’s legislative power.
(3) Subsection (2) does not limit the cases where a contrary intention 
may be taken to appear for the purposes of subsection (1).
(4) This section applies to a provision of this Act, whether enacted 
before, at or after the commencement of this section.
