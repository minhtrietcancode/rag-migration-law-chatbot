Migration Act 1958 91
Compilation No. 164 Compilation date: 21/02/2025(c) prescribe a time (the conversion time) when the regulation is 
to start to apply in relation to a pre-conversion application, 
including different conversion times depending on the 
occurrence of different events.
Visa application charge
(5) If an amount has been paid as the first instalment of the visa 
application charge for a pre-conversion application, then, at and 
after the conversion time in relation to the application:
(a) that payment is taken not to have been paid as the first 
instalment of the visa application charge for the 
pre-conversion application; and
(b) that payment is taken to be payment of the first instalment of 
the visa application charge for the converted application, 
even if the first instalment of the visa application charge that 
would otherwise be payable for the converted application is 
greater than the actual amount paid for the first instalment of 
the visa application charge for the pre-conversion 
application; and
(c) in a case in which the first instalment of the visa application 
charge payable for the converted application is less than the 
actual amount paid for the first instalment of the visa 
application charge for the pre-conversion application, no 
refund is payable in respect of the difference only for that 
reason.
Note: For the visa application charge, see sections 45A, 45B and 45C.
Effect on bridging visas
(6) For the purposes of this Act, if, immediately before the conversion 
time for a pre-conversion application, a person held a bridging visa 
because the pre-conversion application had not been finally 
determined, then, at and after the conversion time, the bridging 
visa has effect as if it had been granted because of the converted 
application.
