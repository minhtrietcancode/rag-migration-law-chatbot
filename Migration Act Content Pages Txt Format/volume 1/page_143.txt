probabilities, that the non-citizen poses the substantial 
risk mentioned in subparagraph (i)â€”the Minister is not 
satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the 
imposition of that condition, or those conditions, is 
reasonably necessary, and reasonably appropriate and

decision and the reasons for the decision.

to the non-citizen.
(7) In this section:
serious offence has the same meaning as in Part 070 of Schedule 2 
to the Migration Regulations 1994.
