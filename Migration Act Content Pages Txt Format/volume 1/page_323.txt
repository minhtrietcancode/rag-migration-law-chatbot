197E  Relevance of Ministerial intervention powers to removal of 
unlawful non-citizens under section 198
(1) For the purposes of section 198, it is irrelevant whether the 
Minister has been requested to exercise, or consider exercising, a 
Ministerial intervention power in relation to an unlawful 
non-citizen.
(2) To avoid doubt:
(a) an officerâ€™s duty to remove as soon as reasonably practicable 
an unlawful non-citizen under section 198 arises irrespective 
of whether the Minister has been requested to exercise, or 
consider exercising, a Ministerial intervention power in 
relation to the unlawful non-citizen; and
(b) the fact that the Minister has been requested to exercise, or 
consider exercising, a Ministerial intervention power in 
relation to an unlawful non-citizen is irrelevant to whether or 
not the removal of the unlawful non-citizen is reasonably 
practicable for the purposes of section 198.
