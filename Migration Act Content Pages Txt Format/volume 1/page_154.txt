90  Order of dealing with limited visas
The fact that an application for a visa of a class or classes to which 
a determination under section 85 applies has not been considered 
or disposed of although an application for another visa of the class 
or classes that was made later has been considered or disposed of 
does not mean, for any purpose, that the consideration or disposal 
of the earlier application is unreasonably delayed.
91  Order of dealing with visas
If a determination under section 85 applies, or has applied, to visas 
of a class or classes, the Minister may consider or, subject to 
section 86, dispose of outstanding and further applications for such 
visas in such order as he or she considers appropriate.
Subdivision AIâ€”Safe third countries
91A  Reason for Subdivision
This Subdivision is enacted because the Parliament considers that 
certain non-citizens who are covered by the CPA, or in relation to 
whom there is a safe third country, should not be allowed to apply 
for a protection visa or, in some cases, any other visa. Any such 
non-citizen who is an unlawful non-citizen will be subject to 
removal under Division 8.
91B  Interpretation
(1) In this Subdivision:
agreement includes a written arrangement or understanding, 
whether or not binding.
CPA means the Comprehensive Plan of Action approved by the 
International Conference on Indo-Chinese Refugees, held at 
Geneva, Switzerland, from 13 to 14 June 1989.
