Reasonable steps to prevent the contravention
(3) In determining whether the executive officer of the body corporate 
failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent the 
sponsorship-related contravention by the body, a court must have 
regard to:
(a) what action (if any) the officer took towards ensuring that the 
body’s employees, agents and contractors had a reasonable 
knowledge and understanding of the requirements to comply 
with this Subdivision, insofar as those requirements affected 
the employees, agents or contractors concerned; and
(b) what action (if any) the officer took when he or she became 
aware that the body was engaging in the sponsorship-related 
contravention.
(4) Subsection (3) does not limit subsection (1).
Definitions
(5) In this section:
negligent: an executive officer of a body corporate is negligent as 
to whether a sponsorship-related contravention would occur if the 
officer’s conduct involves:
(a) such a great falling short of the standard of care that a 
reasonable person would exercise in the circumstances; and
(b) such a high risk that the sponsorship-related contravention 
would occur;
that the conduct merits the imposition of a pecuniary penalty.
reckless: an executive officer of a body corporate is reckless as to 
whether a sponsorship-related contravention would occur if:
(a) the officer is aware of a substantial risk that the 
sponsorship-related contravention would occur; and
(b) having regard to the circumstances known to the officer, it is 
unjustifiable to take the risk.
