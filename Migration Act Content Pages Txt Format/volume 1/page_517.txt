261AE  Use of force in carrying out identification tests
When use of force is permitted
(1) Subject to subsection (2) and section 261AF, an authorised officer, 
or a person authorised under section 261AG to help the authorised 
officer, may use reasonable force:
(a) to enable the identification test to be carried out; or
(b) to prevent the loss, destruction or contamination of any 
personal identifier or any meaningful identifier derived from 
the personal identifier.
However, this section does not authorise the use of force against a 
minor or an incapable person, or if the personal identifier in 
question is a personâ€™s signature.
(2) The officer or person must not use force unless:
(a) the non-citizen required to provide the personal identifier in 
question has refused to allow the identification test to be 
carried out; and
(b) all reasonable measures to carry out the identification test 
without the use of force have been exhausted; and
(c) use of force in carrying out the identification test is 
authorised under subsection (4).
Applications for authorisation to use force
(3) An authorised officer may apply to a senior authorising officer 
(who is not an officer referred to in subsection (1)) for an 
authorisation to use force in carrying out the identification test.
Authorisation to use force
(4) The senior authorising officer may authorise the use of force in 
carrying out the identification test if he or she is reasonably 
satisfied that:
(a) the non-citizen required to provide the personal identifier in 
question has refused to allow the identification test to be 
carried out; and
