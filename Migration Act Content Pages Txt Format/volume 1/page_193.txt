constitute a ground for the cancellation of a visa under 
subsection 133A(1) or (3) include non-compliances that occurred 
at any time (whether before or after the commencement of this 
section), including non-compliances in respect of any previous visa 
held by the person.

section 133A in the same way that it applies in relation to 
Subdivision C.
(3) To avoid doubt, subsections 133A(1) and (3) apply:
(a) whether or not the Minister became aware of the ground for 
cancelling the visa because of information given by the visa 
holder; and
(b) whether the non-compliance because of which the ground is 
considered to exist was deliberate or inadvertent.
(4) Steps taken for the purposes of the Minister exercising the power 
in subsection 133A(1) or (3) in relation to an instance of possible 
non-compliance by a person do not prevent:
(a) a notice under section 107 being given to that person because 
of another instance of possible non-compliance; or
(b) the exercise of the power in subsection 133A(1) or (3) in 
relation to the person because of another instance of possible 
non-compliance.
(5) The non-cancellation of a visa under section 133A despite an 
instance of non-compliance does not prevent the cancellation, or 
steps for the cancellation, of the visa because of another instance of 
non-compliance.
