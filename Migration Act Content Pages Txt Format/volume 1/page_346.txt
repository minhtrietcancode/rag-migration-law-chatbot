(b) the fact that the Minister has been requested to exercise, or 
consider exercising, a Ministerial intervention power in 
relation to an unauthorised maritime arrival is irrelevant to 
whether or not the taking of the unauthorised maritime 
arrival from Australia to a regional processing country is 
reasonably practicable for the purposes of 
subsection 198AD(2).
(3) Subsection (1) applies whether a request is made by:
(a) the unauthorised maritime arrival; or
(b) an officer of the Department; or
(c) any other person.
(4) Subsection (1) applies whether or not a request has been drawn to 
the Ministerâ€™s attention.
Temporary suspension of duty to transfer unauthorised maritime 
arrivals
(5) Despite subsection (1), if the Minister decides to consider whether 
to exercise a Ministerial intervention power (whether on request or 
otherwise) in relation to an unauthorised maritime arrival, 
subsection 198AD(2) does not require or authorise an officer to 
take the unauthorised maritime arrival from Australia to a regional 
processing country during the period covered by subsection (6).
Note: Despite this subsection, an unauthorised maritime arrival who asks the 
Minister, in writing, to be taken from Australia to a regional 
processing country must be taken to that country (see subsection (10)).
Period during which duty to transfer is suspended
(6) For the purposes of subsection (5), the period is 6 months starting 
on the day (the start day) the Minister decides to consider whether 
to exercise the Ministerial intervention power in relation to the 
unauthorised maritime arrival, unless:
(a) before the end of that 6 month period, the unauthorised 
maritime arrival has agreed, in writing, to a day occurring 
after the end of that 6 month period nominated, in writing, by
