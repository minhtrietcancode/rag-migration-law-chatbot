(3) The fact that an unlawful non-citizen is eligible to apply for a 
substantive visa that can be granted when the applicant is in the 
migration zone but has not done so does not prevent the application 
of subsection (2) or (2A) to him or her.
(5) An officer must remove as soon as reasonably practicable an 
unlawful non-citizen if the non-citizen:
(a) is a detainee; and
(b) neither applied for a substantive visa in accordance with 
subsection 195(1) nor applied under section 137K for 
revocation of the cancellation of a substantive visa;
regardless of whether the non-citizen has made a valid application 
for a bridging visa.
(5A) Despite subsection (5), an officer must not remove an unlawful 
non-citizen if:
(a) the non-citizen has made a valid application for a protection 
visa (even if the application was made outside the time 
allowed by subsection 195(1)); and
(b) either:
(i) the grant of the visa has not been refused; or
(ii) the application has not been finally determined.
(6) An officer must remove as soon as reasonably practicable an 
unlawful non-citizen if:
(a) the non-citizen is a detainee; and
(b) the non-citizen made a valid application for a substantive 
visa that can be granted when the applicant is in the 
migration zone; and
(c) one of the following applies:
(i) the grant of the visa has been refused and the 
application has been finally determined;
(ii) the visa cannot be granted; and
(d) the non-citizen has not made another valid application for a 
substantive visa that can be granted when the applicant is in 
the migration zone.
