(a) a person has applied, whether before or after the 
commencement of this section, for the grant of a visa; and
(b) a time was or is reached when the grant of the visa to the 
person in a particular financial year was or is prevented by 
section 86; and
(c) the person was requested by the Minister after that time to 
satisfy requirements for the grant of the visa that relate to 
health or character; and
(d) after the making of the request referred to in paragraph (c) 
the person satisfies the requirements referred to in that 
paragraph in a financial year subsequent to the financial year 
in which the time referred to in paragraph (b) occurred; and
(e) the grant of the visa to the person at the time when the 
requirements referred to in paragraph (c) are satisfied would, 
apart from this section, be prevented by section 86; and
(f) the person was unable to satisfy the requirements referred to 
in paragraph (c) at a time when, apart from this section, 
section 86 would not have prevented the grant of the visa to 
the person; and
(g) the Minister is satisfied that the person’s inability to satisfy 
the requirements referred to in paragraph (c) at a time 
mentioned in paragraph (e) was due to circumstances beyond 
the person’s control;
section 86 does not prevent the grant of the visa to the person.
88  Limit does not affect processing of applications
Section 86’s prevention of the grant of a visa does not prevent any 
other action related to the application for it.
89  Determination of limit not to mean failure to decide
The fact that the Minister has neither granted nor refused to grant a 
visa of a class or classes to which a determination under section 85 
applies does not mean, for any purpose, that the Minister has failed 
to make a decision to grant or refuse to grant the visa.
