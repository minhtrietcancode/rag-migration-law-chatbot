5AB  Sentencing for offences
The provisions of this Act and the regulations apply no differently 
in relation to a single sentence imposed by a court in respect of 2 or 
more offences to the way in which those provisions apply in 
relation to a sentence imposed by a court in respect of a single 
offence.
Example: Paragraph 501(7)(c) applies in relation to a person sentenced to a term 
of imprisonment of 12 months or more. Because of this section, that 
paragraph applies in relation to a person sentenced to such a term, 
whether the sentence is imposed for a single offence or for 2 or more 
offences.
