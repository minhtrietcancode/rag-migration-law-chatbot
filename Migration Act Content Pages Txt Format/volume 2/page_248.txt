494D  Authorised recipient
(1) If a person (the first person) gives the Minister written notice of 
the name and address of another person (the authorised recipient) 
authorised by the first person to receive documents in connection 
with specified matters arising under this Act or the regulations, the 
Minister must give the authorised recipient, instead of the first 
person, any documents in connection with those matters that the 
Minister would otherwise have given to the first person.
Note: If the Minister gives a person a document by a method specified in 
section 494B, the person is taken to have received the document at the 
time specified in section 494C in respect of that method.
(2) If the Minister gives a document to the authorised recipient, the 
Minister is taken to have given the document to the first person. 
However, this does not prevent the Minister giving the first person 
a copy of the document.
(3) Subject to subsection (3A), the first person (but not the authorised 
recipient) may vary or withdraw the notice under subsection (1) at 
any time, but must not (unless the regulations provide otherwise) 
vary the notice so that any more than one person becomes the first 
personâ€™s authorised recipient.
(3A) In addition to the first person being able to vary the notice under 
subsection (1) by varying the address of the authorised recipient, 
that recipient may also vary that notice by varying that address.
(5) The Minister need not comply with subsection (1) if:
(a) the authorised recipient is not a registered migration agent 
(within the meaning of Part 3); and
(b) the Minister reasonably suspects that the authorised recipient 
is giving immigration assistance (within the meaning of that 
Part); and
(c) the Minister has given the first person a notice, by one of the 
methods specified in section 494B, stating that he or she does 
not intend to give the authorised recipient documents as 
mentioned in subsection (1).
