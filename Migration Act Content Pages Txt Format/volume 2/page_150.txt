150 Migration Act 1958
Compilation No. 164 Compilation date: 21/02/2025367  Certain bridging visa decisionsâ€”to be made within prescribed 
period
(1) Subject to subsection (2), if the application is for review of a 
decision covered by subsection 338(4) (certain bridging visa 
decisions), the ART must make its decision on review, and notify 
the applicant of the decision, within the prescribed period.
(2) The ART may, with the agreement of the applicant, extend the 
period in subsection (1) for the purposes of a particular application.
367A  How ART is to deal with new claims or evidence in review of 
reviewable protection decisions
(1) This section applies if, in relation to an application for review of a 
reviewable protection decision (the primary decision), the 
applicant:
(a) raises a claim that was not raised before the primary decision 
was made; or
(b) presents evidence in the application that was not presented 
before the primary decision was made.
(2) In making a decision on the application, the ART is to draw an 
inference unfavourable to the credibility of the claim or evidence if 
the ART is satisfied that the applicant does not have a reasonable 
explanation why the claim was not raised, or the evidence was not 
presented, before the primary decision was made.
367B  Certain ART proceedings must be in private
The hearing of a proceeding (within the meaning of the ART Act) 
for the review of a reviewable protection decision must be in 
private.
Note: Section 69 of the ART Act, which generally requires hearings to be in 
public, applies to hearings of proceedings for the review of reviewable 
migration decisions.
