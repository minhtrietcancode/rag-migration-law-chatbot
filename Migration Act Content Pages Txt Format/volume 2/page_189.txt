486H  Limited waiver of legal professional privilege
(1) If, in proceedings to determine whether an order under 
section 486F should be made:
(a) a person wishes to produce a document, record or 
information for the purpose of arguing why an order under 
section 486F should not be made; and
(b) to do so would, but for this section, deny legal professional 
privilege to any person entitled to claim it;
the person may produce the document, record or information for 
that purpose.
(2) However:
(a) the document, record or information does not cease to be 
subject to legal professional privilege for any other purpose, 
or in any other circumstances; and
(b) the court must make any orders necessary to ensure that legal 
professional privilege is protected for other purposes and in 
other circumstances.
(3) Nothing in this section prevents a person who is entitled to claim 
legal professional privilege in relation to the document, record or 
information, from waiving that privilege.
(4) In this section:
legal professional privilege includes privilege (however described) 
under any provision of Division 1 of Part 3.10 of the Evidence Act 
1995.
