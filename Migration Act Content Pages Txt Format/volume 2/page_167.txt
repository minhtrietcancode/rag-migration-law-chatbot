(b) in connection with such an application, paragraph (1)(b) is 
taken to apply to a notice of a kind referred to in that 
paragraph as if the notice authorised the authorised recipient 
to receive documents in connection with the application 
(including a document notifying that recipient that the 
application is not properly made under either or both of those 
sections).
(2) If the ART gives a document to the authorised recipient, the ART 
is taken to have given the document to the applicant. However, this 
does not prevent the ART giving the applicant a copy of the 
document.
(3) Subject to subsection (3A), the applicant (but not the authorised 
recipient) may vary or withdraw the notice under paragraph (1)(b) 
at any time, but must not (unless the regulations provide otherwise) 
vary the notice so that any more than one person becomes the 
applicantâ€™s authorised recipient.
(3A) In addition to the applicant being able to vary the notice under 
paragraph (1)(b) by varying the address of the authorised recipient, 
that recipient may also vary that notice by varying that address.
(5) This section does not apply to the ART giving documents to, or 
communicating with, the applicant when the applicant is appearing 
before the ART.
