the decision is not invalid, and is taken never to have been invalid, 
merely because:
(c) the Minister:
(i) relied on; or
(ii) had regard to; or
(iii) failed to disclose in accordance with any applicable 
common law or statutory obligation;
information that was covered, or purportedly covered, by 
subsection 503A(1) or (2); or
(d) the Minister made the decision on the basis of an erroneous 
understanding of:
(i) section 503A; or
(ii) the protection that section 503A would provide against 
an obligation to disclose information.
(2) However, subsection (1) does not affect rights or liabilities arising 
between parties to proceedings in which:
(a) judgment is reserved by a court as at the commencement of 
this section; or
(b) judgment has been delivered by a court before the 
commencement of this section;
and the judgment sets aside, or declares invalid, a decision made 
by the Minister under section 501, 501A, 501B, 501BA, 501C or 
501CA.
