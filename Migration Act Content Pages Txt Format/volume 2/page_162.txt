Compilation No. 164 Compilation date: 21/02/2025(2A) However, subsection (2) does not apply if section 379EA (which 
relates to giving documents in the case of combined applications) 
applies in relation to the minor.
(3) If the ART gives a document to an individual, as mentioned in 
subsection (2), the ART is taken to have given the document to the 
minor. However, this does not prevent the ART giving the minor a 
copy of the document.

requires the ART to make an order, the provision is taken, for the 
purposes of this section, to be a provision of the ART Act that 
requires or permits the ART to give a document to a person.
Note: Orders given under section 79 (Tribunal may give directions in 
relation to procedure for proceeding) of the ART Act are dealt with by 
section 374 of this Act.
