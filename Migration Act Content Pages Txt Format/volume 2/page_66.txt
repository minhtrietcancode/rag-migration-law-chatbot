continues to practise, while the stay order is in force, until the agent’s 
registration ends. Subsection 288(6A) prevents the agent from being 
re-registered until the review proceedings are finalised. The agent 
cannot be re-registered if the suspension decision is affirmed on 
review and the suspension would not have ended (had the registration 
continued).
Example 3: Under section 300, a registered migration agent’s registration is 
continued after the expiry day of the agent’s registration. The 
Migration Agents Registration Authority makes a decision to suspend 
the agent’s registration until the agent complies with a condition, and 
so the registration ends because of subsection 300(4). The agent 
cannot be re-registered until the agent complies with the condition.

292B  Applicant must not be registered unless he or she holds

(1) An applicant must not be registered unless the Migration Agents

time applicants).
