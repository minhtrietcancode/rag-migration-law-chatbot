339  Conclusive certificates
The Minister may issue a conclusive certificate in relation to a 
decision if the Minister believes that:
(a) it would be contrary to the national interest to change the 
decision; or
(b) it would be contrary to the national interest for the decision 
to be reviewed.
Note: If the Minister issues a conclusive certificate in relation to a decision, 
the decision is not a reviewable migration decision (see 
paragraph 338(1)(a)) or a reviewable protection decision (see 
paragraph 338A(2)(a)).
