(1) A person is not allowed to make an application for a visa, or have 
an application for a visa made on the person’s behalf, at a 
particular time (the application time) that occurs during a period 
throughout which the person is in the migration zone if:
(a) at an earlier time during that period, the Minister made a 
decision under section 501, 501A, 501B or 501BA to refuse 
to grant a visa to the person or to cancel a visa that has been 
granted to the person; and
(b) the decision was neither set aside nor revoked before the 
application time.
(1A) In relation to the Minister’s decision to refuse to grant a visa to the 
person, as mentioned in paragraph (1)(a), it does not matter 
whether:
(a) the application for the visa was made on the person’s behalf; 
or
(b) the person knew about, or understood the nature of, the 
application for the visa due to:
(i) any mental impairment; or
(ii) the fact that the person was, at the time the application 
was made, a minor.
(1B) In paragraph (1)(a) and subsection (1A), a reference to a refusal to 
grant a visa, or to the cancellation of a visa, includes a reference to 
such a refusal or cancellation in relation to a visa for which an 
application is taken to have been made by the operation of this Act 
or a regulation.
(2) Subsection (1) does not prevent a person, at the application time, 
from making an application for:
(a) a protection visa; or
(b) a visa specified in the regulations for the purposes of this 
subsection.
Note: The person may however be prevented from applying for a protection 
visa because of section 48A.
