Compilation No. 164 Compilation date: 21/02/2025494A  Giving documents by Minister where no requirement to do so 
by section 494B method
(1) If:
(a) a provision of this Act or the regulations requires or permits 
the Minister to give a document to a person; and
(b) the provision does not state that the document must be given:
(i) by one of the methods specified in section 494B; or
(ii) by a method prescribed for the purposes of giving 
documents to a person in immigration detention;
the Minister may give the document to the person by any method 
that he or she considers appropriate (which may be one of the 
methods mentioned in subparagraph (b)(i) or (ii) of this section).
Note: Section 494D deals with giving documents to a person’s authorised 
recipient.
(2) If a person is a minor, the Minister may give a document to an 
individual who is at least 18 years of age if the Minister reasonably 
believes that:
(a) the individual has day-to-day care and responsibility for the 
minor; or
(b) the individual works in or for an organisation that has 
day-to-day care and responsibility for the minor and the 
individual’s duties, whether alone or jointly with another 
person, involve care and responsibility for the minor.
(3) However, subsection (2) does not apply if subsection 52(3C) 
(which relates to giving notifications in the case of combined 
applications) applies in relation to the minor.
(4) If the Minister gives a document to an individual, as mentioned in 
subsection (2), the Minister is taken to have given the document to 
the minor. However, this does not prevent the Minister giving the 
minor a copy of the document.
(5) This section does not apply to the giving of any of the following 
documents:
(a) a document relating to the proposed cancellation of a visa;
