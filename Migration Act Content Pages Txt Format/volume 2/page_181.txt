review

migration decision must be made to the court within 35 days of the 
date of the migration decision.
(2) The High Court may, by order, extend that 35 day period as the 
High Court considers appropriate if:
(a) an application for that order has been made in writing to the 
High Court specifying why the applicant considers that it is 
necessary in the interests of the administration of justice to 
make the order; and
(b) the High Court is satisfied that it is necessary in the interests 
of the administration of justice to make the order.
(3) In this section:
date of the migration decision has the meaning given by 
subsection 477(3).

decision in subsection 477(3).

period begins to run irrespective of the validity of the migration
