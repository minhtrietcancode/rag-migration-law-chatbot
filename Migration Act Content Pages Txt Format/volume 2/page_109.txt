Migration Act 1958 109
Compilation No. 164 Compilation date: 21/02/2025(b) the Migration Agents Registration Authority had not made a 
decision in relation to the application.
Application of amendments to registration applications
(2) The amendments of Division 3 made by Schedule 1 to the 
amending Act apply in relation to the registration application as if 
it had been made on or after the Division 8 commencement day.
Note: On and after the Division 8 commencement day, some Australian 
legal practitioners cannot be registered as migration agents (see 
section 289B).
(3) If the person was an unrestricted legal practitioner immediately 
before the Division 8 commencement day, section 300 (automatic 
continuation of registration) does not apply on and after that day in 
relation to the registration application.
Note: If the registration had been taken to continue under subsection 300(4) 
before the Division 8 commencement day, the registration would end 
at the start of that day (see section 333B).
(4) Despite section 291 (applicant must not be registered if registration 
refused in past year), if the personâ€™s registration application is 
refused because of section 289B (inserted by Schedule 1 to the 
amending Act), the refusal of the application does not prevent the 
person from being registered as a migration agent in accordance 
with a later registration application made at any time on or after the 
Division 8 commencement day.
333E  Events required to be notified under s 312(4)
Subsection 312(4) (added by Schedule 1 to the amending Act) 
applies to require a registered migration agent to notify the 
Migration Agents Registration Authority that the agent has become 
a restricted or unrestricted legal practitioner if the agent becomes 
such a practitioner on or after the Division 8 commencement day.
