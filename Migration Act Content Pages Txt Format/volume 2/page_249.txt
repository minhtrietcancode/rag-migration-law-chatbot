494E  When documents are taken to comply with content 
requirements
(1) This section applies in relation to a document if:
(a) a provision of this Act or the regulations requires or permits 
the Minister to give the document to a person; and
(b) a provision of this Act or the regulations requires (the 
content requirements) the document to include particular 
information.
(2) For the purposes of this Act or the regulations, the document is 
taken to comply with the content requirements if:
(a) there is substantial compliance with those requirements; and
(b) the failure to strictly comply with those requirements does 
not, or is not likely to, cause substantial prejudice to the 
person’s rights (including, but not limited to, rights to seek 
review in connection with the matter to which the document 
relates).
(3) Subsection (2) applies despite any other provision of this Act or the 
regulations.
(4) Without limiting paragraph (2)(a), there may be substantial 
compliance with the content requirements even if there is an error, 
omission, misstatement or misdescription in the document.
(5) Without limiting paragraph (2)(b), a failure by the person to:
(a) exercise any rights (including, but not limited to, rights to 
seek review) in connection with the matter to which the 
document relates; or
(b) take any other action (including, but not limited to, the 
making of representations) in connection with the matter to 
which the document relates;
is not on its own to be taken to imply that the failure to strictly 
comply with the content requirements has caused substantial 
prejudice to the person’s rights (including, but not limited to, rights 
to seek review in connection with the matter to which the 
document relates).
